        How Wetlands Could Protect Against Hurricanes and Floods </h1>

      <div class="text"> Grassy wetlands act as a buffer against storm surges, giving hurricanes more to conquer before reaching people and buildings. Much of New Yorkâ€™s waterfronts are wetlands, but they mostly exist around Staten Island, Long Island and Jamaica Bay. </div>


      <div class="icon">
        <img src="FLOOD.png" alt="Drawing of a flood"></div>
      <div class="text"> Wetlands act like sponges and can hold onto water from storms. The water is stored and later released at a slower rate than it would be during a hurricane.</div>


      <div class="icon">
        <img src="FILTER.png" alt="Drawing of a filter"></div>
      <div class="text">The reduction in water flow helps debris and other solids settle into the land before being released onto land or into other bodies of water. Biofilm, a cluster of bacteria on the surface of wetlands, collect some pollutants. This process helps store debris from high winds.
</div>

      <div class="text">The plants and low-lying areas of wetlands weaken the overall energy of winds. The ecosystem of wetlands can also lessen the wave heights of storm surges.
